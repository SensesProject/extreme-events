# Extreme Events

Climate change makes extreme events more frequent and more intense. This will increase fatalities, displacement, poverty and economic damage.

+++ intro 1

At +2°C global warming about 6.8% of the global land area is exposed to @yellow(heatwaves) at least once a year – a 20-fold increase compared to pre-industrial temperature levels.

+++ intro 2

For @neon(tropical cyclones) which mostly affect island states in the indian and pacific ocean, the increase in exposed land is far lower. But impacts are likely to be more severe due to highly populated coastal regions.

+++ intro 3

The Region of Pakistan, northern India and Nepal shows the highest exposure to @orange(crop failure.) Given that thses events are confined to agricultural land, the exposure is also largely dependent on human factors.

+++ cat-intro

Extents and impacts of extreme events depend on underlying meteorological, hydrological, and climatological events. But as we have already seen in the case of crop failure also on human factors such as land use, water and agricultural management, and population density.

In this module we show six extreme event categories: glyph(tropical-cyclone) tropical cyclone, glyph(river-flood) river flood, glyph(crop-failure) crop failure, glyph(wildfire) wildfire, glyph(drought) drought, and glyph(heatwave) heatwave.

At the global scale we look at how these affect land and population at different levels of global warming and discuss modeling uncertainty. On the national scale we show which countries are most exposed to extreme events and their geographical and economical setting.

+++ categories river-flood 0

## River Flood glyph(river-floods)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.

+++ categories river-flood 1

river 1

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories river-flood 2

river 2

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories river-flood 3

river 3

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories wildfire

## Wildfire glyph(wildfire)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories tropical-cyclone

## Tropical Cyclone glyph(tropical-cyclone)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories crop-failure

## Crop Failure glyph(crop-failure)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories drought

## Drought glyph(drought)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.

+++ categories heatwave

## Heatwave glyph(heatwave)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.

Here, the four major crops maize, wheat, soybean, and rice, are considered. If yields fall below the 2.5th percentile of the preindustrial baseline distribution crop failure is assessed. For population, only people working in agriculture are considered vulnerable.
