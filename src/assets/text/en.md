# Extreme Events

Climate change makes extreme events more frequent and more intense. This will increase fatalities, displacement, poverty and economic damage.

+++ intro 1

At +2°C global warming about 6.8% of the global land area is exposed to @yellow(heatwaves) at least once a year – a 20-fold increase compared to pre-industrial temperature levels.

+++ intro 2

For @neon(tropical cyclones) which mostly affect island states in the indian and pacific ocean, the increase in exposed land is far lower. But impacts are likely to be more severe due to highly populated coastal regions.

+++ intro 3

The Region of Pakistan, northern India and Nepal shows the highest exposure to @orange(crop failure.) Given that thses events are confined to agricultural land, the exposure is also largely dependent on human factors.

## Extreme events and climate change: The example of temperature
In the example here we show the typical distribution of temperatures (the daily average temperatures). When we put these temperatures on the horizontal axis, and plot the number of days, that feature that temperature within a year on the vertical axis, we obtain the shown plot. This plot shows how the temperatures are distributed over the course of a year, and fittingly such a plot is known as a i"distribution". The distribution shown here is know as the ["normal distribution"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). While for instance the daily average temperature or the daily air pressure follow this type of distribution, not all meteorological quantities do. An example of a quantity following a different distribution is the daily precipitation. Still, temperature and the normal distribution are useful example when discussing extreme events.

+++ dist 1

Technically, extreme events are events that lie at both the lower and the higher tail ends of a distribution. One can see that while the number of days at a given point that feature the average temperature is the largest, the really high or low temperatures occur only on very few days. So extreme events have two properties: They feature the most extreme values, i.e. the highest or the lowest observed values, and they are rare.

+++ dist 2

A normal distribution is characterized by two numbers, its "mean" (μ, pronunciation "myu"), i.e. the temperature that occurs most often, and its "variance" (σ pronunciation "sigma"), the width of the distribution. Climate change generally changes both of these values, so, while the distribution is shifted to the right (increased "mean"), it is also stretched (increased "sigma").

+++ dist 3

We can see that in the distribution that has undergone climate change temperatures that have been extreme and rare in the past, occur now much more frequently (light red) and even @red(higher temperatures) are reached (dark red). 

+++ dist 4

The former extreme events turn into the new normal. At the same time, since the new distribution has a larger variance, cold days (light blue area) still occur. So cold days don't mean that climate change has not happened.

+++ cat-intro

Extents and impacts of extreme events depend on underlying meteorological, hydrological, and climatological events. But as we have already seen in the case of crop failure also on human factors such as land use, water and agricultural management, and population density.

In this module we show six extreme event categories: glyph(tropical-cyclone) tropical cyclone, glyph(river-flood) river flood, glyph(crop-failure) crop failure, glyph(wildfire) wildfire, glyph(drought) drought, and glyph(heatwave) heatwave.

At the global scale we look at how these affect land and population at different levels of global warming and discuss modeling uncertainty. On the national scale we show which countries are most exposed to extreme events and their geographical and economical setting.

## River Flood glyph(river-floods)

Agricultural land spatially confines where crop failure may occur. People working in agriculture are primarily affected to crop failure since trade can typically mitigate shortages. That limits both how much land area and how many people can such events affect.
