# Extreme Events

With an increase in global mean temperatures, extreme events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves could become more frequent and severe.

+++ intro 1

At +2\,°C global warming, @yellow(heatwaves) will affect substantial portions of the global land surface.

+++ intro 2

Coastal regions – some of them densely populated – are increasingly exposed to @neon(tropical cyclones).

+++ intro 3

And agriculture might increasingly suffer from @orange(crop failure).

+++ intro-module

In this module, we take a global perspective focussing less on spatial distributions but the general relationship between rising temperatures and the exposure of land and population to extreme events. 

We explore six types of extreme events, namely glyph(heatwave) heatwaves, glyph(drought) droughts, glyph(crop-failure) crop failure, glyph(wildfire) wildfires, glyph(river-flood) river floods and glyph(tropical-cyclone) tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we discuss the uncertainty in these extreme event projections.

+++ dist-intro

## Defining Extreme Events

Climate impacts are the effects of climate change on {nature}(e.g. the bleaching of coral reefs) and {society}(e.g. decreased work productivity due to excessive heat). New meteorological extremes cause increasingly drastic climate impacts. When they surpass a certain threshold, we call them extreme events.

+++ dist 1.1

Temperature is a major driver for many extreme events. Let us consider all days in a year. In this figure, each dot represents a day which we placed horizontally based on their temperature, starting with cold days on the left.

+++ dist 1.3
It results in a normal distribution with most days having fairly @gray(average temperatures). Extreme events, here particularly @blue(cold) or @orange(hot) days lie in the tails of the distribution. They are quite rare.

+++ dist 2

Under climate change, the mean temperature rises, and the distribution shifts to higher temperatures. Hot days that have been rare in the past occur now @orange(more frequently) and reach even @red(higher temperatures).

+++ dist 3

Additionally, the variance increases: Formerly average temperatures become less frequent, and the distribution spreads out.
Hot temperatures become even more @orange(frequent) and @red(extreme). Cold days still occur but become @blue(rarer).

+++ cat-intro

Other drivers for extreme events considered here are, for instance, precipitation and humidity. Not all of them follow a normal distribution, but they experience changes to their distribution under climate change and can reach new extremes. 

In this analysis, we define the thresholds of what constitutes an extreme event relative to the preindustrial climate. It allows us to examine changes in temperatures, that already occur today, as well as a glimpse at future global warming levels.




+++ cat-exposure 1

## Exposure to Extreme Events

We discuss two aspects of extreme events: The share of {global land area}(Global land surface except for Greenland and Antarctica) as well as the share of the {global population}(Based on total population and population distribution from 
2005 to isolate the pure climate change effect) exposed to them every year. 

The analysis bases on impact projections that originate from the [ISIMIP project](https://www.isimip.org). A collection of impact model simulations driven by the same input data to enable cross-model and cross-sector comparisons. 

+++ cat-heatwave-title

## Heatwaves glyph(heatwave)

+++ cat-heatwave-definition

### Land area

The area where both, a relative indicator based on temperature (Russo et al., 2015, 2017) and an absolute indicator, called Humidex, based on temperature and relative humidity (Masterton & Richardson, 1979) exceed their respective threshold value for at least three days in a year.

### Population

The total population of the exposed land area.

+++ cat-heatwave 0°C

At a @blue(preindustrial) warming level of @blue(+0\,°C), only a relatively small fraction of the global area is exposed to heatwaves. These areas have an above-average population density resulting in a slightly higher share when it comes to the exposed population.

+++ cat-heatwave 1°C

At @!L1(+1\,°C), which roughly translates to @yellow(today's climate), there is already a more than @yellow(eight times increase) in exposed land area and population.

+++ cat-heatwave 2°C

One of the thresholds in our heatwave definition is in terms of human physiology ({Humidex}(A measure of how the human body reacts to atmospheric conditions)). While a humidex of 40 to 45 is already associated with great discomfort and exertion should be avoided, we chose a Humidex above 45, which is considered dangerous and where heatstrokes are quite possible.
 
At @!L3(+2\,°C) close to @red(1 billion people) are exposed to them every year. Limiting global warming to @!L2(+1.5\,°C), will help us to keep those numbers considerably lower.

+++ cat-heatwave spread

So far, we looked at multi-model medians of spatially and temporally aggregated data. The outputs from the individual climate models give us a better picture of uncertainty.

The trend remains clear, but uncertainties increase with @!L3(higher temperatures).

+++ cat-heatwave spread 3

At @!L4(+3\,°C) we only have data for @!C1,2(two climate models). It is because only two climate models ran until the year 2300, thus reaching @!L4(+3\,°C), while the others only ran until 2100. But they paint a dire picture, with about a quarter of the global population exposed to dangerous heatwaves.

We will not explain all extreme events in that much detail, but rather focus on their most relevant aspects. You can always use the key to explore the temperature levels in more detail and switch between median and model view.

+++ cat-drought-title

## Droughts glyph(drought)

+++ cat-drought-definition

### Land area

The area where soil moisture falls below the 2.5th percentile of preindustrial values for at least 7 consecutive months.

### Population

Rural population (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017) of exposed land area.

+++ cat-drought median

In the case of droughts, the output of the {four climate models}(depicted as columns) is processed by {eight hydrological models}(depicted as dots; their median as lines). The large spread across these impact models shows the uncertainty in drought projections, now caused by both the climate and the impact models. Still, all impact models @!S0I1C1,3(but one) project an increasing exposure for all climate models.

+++ cat-drought climate

In terms of median results, we see a twofold increase in exposed land from @!L0(preindustrial levels) to @!L3(+2\,°C), but only a moderate increase in the exposed population. Warming up to @!L3(+3\,°C) degrees, however, is projected to substantially increase both the area and the population exposed to droughts.

+++ cat-drought impact

Of the extreme events discussed here, heatwaves and droughts, are projected to affect the largest areas.

+++ cat-crop-failure-title

## Crop Failure glyph(crop-failure)

+++ cat-crop-failure-definition

### Land area

The area where yields of {considered crops}(maize, wheat, soybean, and rice) fall short of the 2.5th percentile of preindustrial ones.

### Population

Population employed in agriculture in the exposed land area.

+++ cat-crop-failure median

In contrast to heatwaves and droughts, crop failure is confined to cropland. While there is no substantial change in exposure at @!L1(+1\,°C), the increase in exposed land becomes apparent at @!L2(+1.5\,°C) and for the exposed population there's a substantial increase at @!L3(+2\,°C)

+++ cat-crop-failure climate

In @!L0(preindustrial) climate exposure is generally low and all climate and impact model combinations return quite consistent results.

+++ cat-crop-failure impact

At @!L3(+2\,°C) the models show a less uniform picture. Most notably, the climate model {GFDL-ESM2M}(First column from the left.) projects significantly higher exposure for land and population. Similarly to the previous case of droughts, the exposed land area and population increases tremendously with warming from @!L3(+2\,°C) to @!L3(+3\,°C). 

Apart from the uncertainties in the modelling chain, there is another effect that contributes to uncertainties in crop modelling: So far we don’t know exactly to what magnitude the CO₂ fertilization amounts and some leeway exists in associating a CO₂ concentration to a particular global warming level.

Besides the yield calculations from the crop models, the projection of the future cropland areas is another source of uncertainty. These derive from assumptions about future population numbers, market prices, technologies and so on, which are difficult to anticipate.


+++ cat-wildfire-title

## Wildfire glyph(wildfire)

+++ cat-wildfire-definition

### Land area

Annual aggregate of monthly burned land area simulated by global vegetation models.

### Population

The total population of burned land area.

+++ cat-wildfire median

For wildfire, discrepancies across climate models are almost neglectable. However @!S0I3,4C0(two of the impact models) produce vastly different results, which is due to {diverging approaches to vegetation modelling}(See [TODO reference to paper supplement, page X-7] for details). These two also have a much larger sensitivity to the warming level than the other three, which project almost the same exposure regardless of the warming level.

+++ cat-wildfire climate

For wildfire, discrepancies across climate models are almost neglectable. However @!I3,4C0(two of the impact models) produce vastly different results. This is due to {diverging approaches to vegetation modelling}(See [TODO reference to paper supplement, page X-7] for details).

+++ cat-wildfire impact

For wildfire, discrepancies across climate models are almost neglectable. However @!I3,4(two of the impact models) produce vastly different results. This is due to {diverging approaches to vegetation modelling}(See [TODO reference to paper supplement, page X-7] for details).



+++ cat-river-flood-title

## River Floods glyph(river-flood)

+++ cat-river-flood-definition

### Land area

Flooding is assumed to occur wherever the daily {discharge}(water that flows in a river) exceeds the preindustrial 100-year return level. The 100-year return level is the largest discharge that typically occurs within 100 years.

### Population

The total population of exposed land area.

+++ cat-river-flood median

River flood projections across impact models are rather consistent with most of the uncertainty resulting from climate models which are known to be challenged when it comes to reproducing extreme precipitation events.

+++ cat-river-flood climate

The exposure to river floods for both, land area and population, largely depends on flood protection measures. The projections assume a flood protection level capable of withstanding the largest discharges that occur within 100 years in preindustrial conditions. However, to assume this globally is quite optimistic. 

+++ cat-river-flood impact

When looking at the FLOPROS (Scussolini, 2016) database, one can see by far the {largest parts of the world do not reach such protection levels}(Only Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, UK, USA, and a few other countries reach or exceed a 100-year flood protection level.). [there is a FLOPROS map, see http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~slange/counting_extremes_si.pdf page X-35]

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone-title

## Tropical Cyclones glyph(tropical-cyclone)

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone-definition

### Land area

The area exposed to 1-minute sustained {hurricane-force winds}(at least 64\,kt, about 120\,km/h) at least once a year; information required about wind fields is derived from the central location and minimum pressure / maximum wind speed (Emanuel, 2013; Geiger et al., 2018).

### Population

The total population of exposed land area.

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone median

Some of the regions most exposed to tropical cyclones are densely populated. At higher warming levels, the share of the global exposed population considerably increases. 

Exposure projections for tropical cyclones are rather conservative, as we only consider the hurricane-force winds but neither storm surges nor heavy precipitation, both typically co-occurring phenomena in a tropical cyclone.

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone climate

In contrast to the earlier examples, projections for tropical cyclones are driven by a single impact model. However, for every climate model and warming level, 100 runs of possible tropical cyclones were executed. 

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone impact

Unsurprisingly, these runs project similar outcomes. Therefore, we can attribute most of the model spread to climate models.

+++ conclusion

## Conclusion

When interpreting projections of extreme events, we may take different perspectives. In this module, we looked into the global exposure of land area and population and at the variance and uncertainty across climate and impact models. 

Uncertainties originate from various stages in the modelling chain, but also from:

- a lack of understanding in {some physical processes}(e.g. the CO₂ fertilization effect)
- limitations of exposure measures
- limitations of extreme event definitions
- {adaptation efforts}(e.g. the flood protection level)
- omitted effects of socio-economic development (e.g. changing population numbers and patterns)
- negligence of tipping points

Still, the overall picture remains clear and allows for definite statements:

- climate change already led to increased exposure to extreme events, as can be seen from the [TODO +1\,°C] results
- further climate change will exacerbate that
- the difference between a @orange(+1.5\,°C) and a @red(+2\,°C) world can be severe, as vividly exemplified by the heatwave results
