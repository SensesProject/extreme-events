# Extreme Events

With an increase in global mean temperatures, extreme events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves become more frequent and severe.

+++ intro 1

At +2\,°C global warming, @yellow(heatwaves) affect substantial portions of the world's land surface.

+++ intro 2

Coastal regions – some of them densely populated – are increasingly exposed to @neon(tropical cyclones).

+++ intro 3

And agriculture will suffer more and more from @orange(crop failure).

+++ intro-module

In this module, we take a global perspective focussing less on spatial distributions but on the general relationship between rising temperatures and the exposure of land and population to extreme events. 

We explore six types of extreme events, namely glyph(heatwave) heatwaves, glyph(drought) droughts, glyph(crop-failure) crop failure, glyph(wildfire) wildfires, glyph(river-flood) river floods and glyph(tropical-cyclone) tropical cyclones. Furthermore, we discuss the uncertainty in these extreme event projections.

+++ dist-intro

## Defining Extreme Events

Climate impacts are the the of climate change on {nature}(e.g. the bleaching of coral riffs due to the acidification of oceans) and {society}(e.g. decreased work productivity due to excessive heat). New meteorological extremes cause increasingly drastic climate impacts. When they surpass a certain threshold we call them extreme events.

+++ dist 1.1

Temperature is a major driver for many extreme events. In this figure, each dot represents a day which we placed horizontally based on their temperature, starting with cold days on the left.

+++ dist 1.3
This results in a normal distribution with most days having fairly average temperatures. Extreme events, here, particularly @blue(cold) or @orange(hot) days lie in the tails of the distribution. They are quite rare.

+++ dist 2

Under climate change, the mean temperature rises and shifts the distribution to higher temperatures. Hot days that have been rare in the past occur now @orange(more frequently) and reach @red(higher temperatures).

+++ dist 3

Additionally, the variance increases: Average temperatures become less frequent and the distribution spreads out.
Hot temperatures become even more @orange(frequent) and @red(extreme). Cold days still occur but become @blue(rarer).

+++ cat-intro

Other drivers for extreme events are among others precipitation and humidity. Not all of them follow a normal distribution but they also tend to become extreme. 

The thresholds of what constitutes extreme events are mostly defined in terms of the preindustrial climate. This allows us to examine extreme events at todays and future global warming levels.




+++ cat-exposure 1

## Exposure to Extreme Events

We discuss two aspects of extreme events: The share of {global land area}(Global land surface with the exception of Greenland and Antarctica) as well as the share of the {global population}(Based on total population and population distribution from 
2005 to isolate the pure climate change effect) exposed to them every year. 

The analysis is based on impact projections that originate from the [ISIMIP project](https://www.isimip.org), a collection of impact model simulations driven by the same input data to enable cross-model and cross-sector comparison. 

+++ cat-heatwave-title

## Heatwaves glyph(heatwave)

+++ cat-heatwave-definition

### Land area

Area where both, a relative indicator based on temperature (Russo et al., 2015, 2017) and an absolute indicator based on temperature and relative humidity (Masterton & Richardson, 1979) exceed their respective threshold value for at least three days in a year.

### Population

Total population of exposed land area.

+++ cat-heatwave 0°C

At a @blue(preindustrial warming level of +0\,°C), only a relatively small fraction of the global area is exposed to heatwaves. These areas have an above average population density resulting to a slightly higher share in the exposed population.

+++ cat-heatwave 1°C

At @yellow(+1\,°C), which roughly translates to @yellow(today's climate), there is already a more than @yellow(eight times increase) in exposed land area and population.

+++ cat-heatwave 2°C

We define heatwave in terms of human physiology. The chosen threshold, a {Humidex}(A measure of how the human body reacts to atmospheric conditions) of 45, is considered dangerous as heatstrokes can occur.
 
At @red(+2\,°C) close to @red(1 billion people) are exposed to them every year.

+++ cat-heatwave 1.5°C

Limiting global warming to @orange(+1.5\,°C), will help us to keep those numbers considerably lower.

+++ cat-heatwave spread

So far, we looked at multi-model medians of spatially and temporally aggregated data. The outputs from the individual climate models give us a better picture of uncertainty.

+++ cat-heatwave spread 3

With higher temperatues the uncertainty increases.
So far, we looked at multi-model medians. Looking at the climate models separately shows us underlying uncertainty.

+++ cat-drought-title

## Droughts glyph(drought)

+++ cat-drought-definition

### Land area

Area where soil moisture falls below the 2.5th percentile of preindustrial values for at least 7 consecutive months.

### Population

Rural population (Klein Goldewijk et al., 2017) of exposed land area.

+++ cat-drought spread

In the case of droughts, the output of the {four climate models}(depicted as columns) is then processed by {eight hydrological models}(depicted as dots; their median as lines). The large spread across these impact models shows the uncertainty in drought projections, now caused by both the climate and the impact models. Still, all impact models {but one}(The hydrological model H08 projects a decrease in drought exposure for two climate models) project an increasing exposure for all climate models.

+++ cat-drought median

In terms of median results, we see a twofold increase in exposed land from @blue(preindustrial levels) to @red(+2\,°C), but only a moderate increase in exposed population.

Both, heatwaves and droughts, count as extensive events, meaning the potentially exposed land area is not confined by {non-climate related factors}(e.g., land use or topography). Therefore, the share of exposed land area is also the highest for those two events.

+++ cat-crop-failure-title

## Crop Failure glyph(crop-failure)

+++ cat-crop-failure-definition

### Land area

Area where yields of {considered crops}(maize, wheat, soybean, and rice) fall short of the 2.5th percentile of preindustrial yields.

### Population

Population employed in agricualture in exposed land area.

+++ cat-crop-failure 1

In contrast, crop failure is confined to crop land. While there is no substential change in exposure at @yellow(+1\,°C), the incresase in exposed land becomes apparent at @orange(+1.5\,°C) and for exposed population there's a substential increase at @red(+2\,°C)

+++ cat-crop-failure 2

In @blue(preindustrial) climate exposure is generally low and all climate and impact model combinations return quite consistent results.

+++ cat-crop-failure 3

At @red(+2\,°C) the models show a less uniform picture. Most notably, the climate model {GFDL-ESM2M}(First column from the left.) projects significantly higher exposure for land and population.

Apart from the uncertainties in the modeling chain, there is another effect that contributes to uncertainties in crop modelling: So far we don’t know exactly to what magnitude the CO₂ fertilization amounts, and furthermore some leeway exists in associating a CO₂ concentration to a particular global warming level.


+++ cat-wildfire-title

## Wildfire glyph(wildfire)

+++ cat-wildfire-definition

### Land area

Annual aggregate of monthly burned land area simulated by global vegetation models.

### Population

Total population of burned land area.

+++ cat-wildfire 1

For wildfire, discrepancies across climate models are almost neglectable. However {two of the impact models}(ORCHIDEE and VISIT) produce vastly different results. This is due to {diverging approaches to vegetation modelling}(See [TODO reference to paper supplement, page X-7] for details).

+++ cat-wildfire 2

[not sure if we need this one, *it looks quite boring* / I'd leave it in, for the sake of being complete]

+++ cat-river-flood-title

## River Floods glyph(river-flood)

+++ cat-river-flood-definition

### Land area

Flooding is assumed to occur wherever daily {discharge}(water that flows in a river) exceeds the preindustrial 100-year return level.

### Population

Total population of exposed land area.

+++ cat-river-flood 1

River flood projections across impact models are rather concistent with most of the uncertainty resulting from climate models which are known to show poor performance when it comes to reproducing extreme precipitation events.

+++ cat-river-flood 2

The exposure to river floods for both, land area and population, largely depends flood protection measures. The projections assume a flood protection level capable of withstanding the largest discharges that occur within 100 years in preindustrial conditions. However, assuming this globally is rather optimistic. When looking at the FLOPROS (Scussolini, 2016) database, one can see by far the {largest parts of the world do not reach such protection levels}(Only Australia, Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, UK, USA, and a few other countries reach or exceed a 100-year flood protection level.).  [there is a FLOPROS map, see http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~slange/counting_extremes_si.pdf page X-35]

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone-title

## Tropical Cyclones glyph(tropical-cyclone)

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone-definition

### Land area

Area exposed to 1-minute sustained {hurricane-force winds}(at least 64\,kt, about 120\,km/h) at least once a year; information required about wind fields is derived from center location and minimum pressure / maximum wind speed (Emanuel, 2013; Geiger et al., 2018).

### Population

Total population of exposed land area.

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone 1

Some of the regions most exposed to tropical cyclones are densely populated. At higher warming levels, the share of the global exposed population is considerably increased. 

Exposure projections for tropical cyclones are rather conservative, as we only consider the hurricane-force winds but neither storm surges nor heavy precipitation, both typically co-occuring phenomena in a tropical cyclone.

+++ cat-tropical-cyclone 2

In contrast to the earlier examples, projections for tropical cyclones are driven by a single impact model. However, for every climate model and warming level 100 runs of possible tropical cyclones were executed. Unsuprisingly, these runs project similar outcomes. Therefore, we can attribute most of the model spread to the climate models.

+++ conclusion

## Conclusion

When interpreting projections of extreme events we may take different perspectives. In this module we looked into the global exposure of land area and population and at the variance and uncertainty across climate and impact models. 

Uncertainties originate from various stages in the modelling chain, but also from:

- a lack of understanding in {some physical processes}(e.g. the CO₂ fertilization effect)
- limitations of exposure measures
- limitations of extreme event definitions
- {adaptation efforts}(e.g. the flood protection level)
- omitted effects of socio-economic development (e.g. changing population numbers and patterns)

Still, the overall picture remains clear and allows for definite statements:

- climate change already led to increased exposure to extreme events
- further climate change will excacerbate that
- the difference between a @orange(+1.5\,°C) and a @red(+2\,°C) world can be severe
